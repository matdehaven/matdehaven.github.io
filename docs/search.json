Topics covered will include version control, the Visual Studio Code IDE, programming basics, environments, functional programming, unit testing, data vizualization, data science, and more. Material will be presented using the programming language R, with some time spent on introductions to Python, Julia, and some basics of HTML. By the end of the course students should feel comfortable in the major programming languages used in economic research and in producing their own work as a replicable, sustainable project.\n\n\nTeaching Reviews\nSpring 2024"

    "text": "Published Article in the Journal of Risk and Financial Management.\n\nAbstract\nWe use machine learning techniques on textual data to identify financial crises. One of the challenges in financial crisis management is being able to determine whether a country is in a crisis or not, or what type of crisis a country is in, especially in real time. The onset of a crisis and its severity also has implications for real economic activity and, hence can be a valuable input into macroprudential, monetary, and fiscal policy. The academic literature and the policy realm rely mostly on expert judgment to determine crises. Consequently, the identification of crises and the buildup-phases of vulnerabilities are usually determined with hindsight. Although we can identify and forecast a good portion of various degrees of crises worldwide with traditional econometric techniques using readily available markets data, we find that textual data helps in reducing false-positives and false-negatives in out-of-sample testing of such models, especially when the crises are considered more severe.\n\nFigure 11: US OECD Economic Outlook with LIME Highlighting\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nChen, Mary, Matthew DeHaven, Isabel Kitschelt, Seung Jung Lee, and Martin J.

    "text": "The official FEDS Note.\n\nSummary\nThe downturn in global economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was unique both for its causes and for its severity. Even though, on a global scale, the recent contraction is unprecedented in modern times, it is useful to look at the consequences of large recessions which affected individual countries in the past. In this note, we draw insights about the ongoing global recovery by looking at the evolution of several economic indicators in the aftermath of past recessions.\nWe find that, following severe contractions, output typically remains well below its pre-recession trend in the medium term. This behavior is more marked for severe recessions that are accompanied by financial crises, while severe but short contractions result in a faster recovery. The post-COVID-19 recovery appears to be much more rapid than in standard severe recessions, putting it roughly in line with severe and short recessions of the past.\nWe argue that outsized policy interventions in response to COVID-19 provided unprecedented support to households and firms, preventing a more prolonged downturn. Furthermore, productivity is likely to be more resilient compared to past slumps, which should help to sustain the pace of the recovery in the coming years.\n\nFigure 1: GDP Recovery after “Severe Recessions”\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nCaldara, Dario, Matthew DeHaven, Francesco Ferrante, and Matteo Iacoviello (2021). “The Global Recovery: Lessons from the Past,” FEDS Notes.
