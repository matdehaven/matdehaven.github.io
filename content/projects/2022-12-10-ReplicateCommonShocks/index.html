<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Their paper identifies 4 diffent shocks (growth, monetary, hedging risk premium, common risk premium) by using sign restricted SVAR on daily data of stock prices and the nominal yield curve. With the shock decomposition in hand they then compare the weight of shocks on different days: FOMC announcement days, macro variable releases, etc.</p>
