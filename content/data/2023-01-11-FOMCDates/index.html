<h4>Description</h4>
<p>FOMC meetings are every six weeks, on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the schedule has changed across the years.</p>
<p>Importantly, only recently did the Federal Reserve start having a press conference on the last meeting day.</p>
<p>Here I scrape the Federal Reserveâ€™s website to pull the most recent meeting days and the historical ones from their archive.</p>
<p>There are a few manual adjustments for some non-standard format meetings.</p>
