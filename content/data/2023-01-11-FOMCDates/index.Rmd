#### Description

FOMC meetings are every six weeks, on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the schedule has changed across the years.

Importantly, only recently did the Federal Reserve start having a press conference on the last meeting day.

Here I scrape the Federal Reserve's website to pull the most recent meeting days and the historical ones from their archive.

There are a few manual adjustments for some non-standard format meetings.
