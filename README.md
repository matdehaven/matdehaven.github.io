# My Personal Academic Website

Built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

See my [quarto-academic-website](https://github.com/matdehaven/quarto-academic-website) Github repository for a template if you'd like to try making one yourself.

My own website has a few additions.

## Useful Quarto Documentation Links

[Creating Citeable Articles](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/create-citeable-articles.html)

# Customization

## Custom HTML Title-block Templates

[Quarto's Title Blocks Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html)

The [default Quarto title block](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/templates/title-block.html) for articles.

I added two possible buttons to display a `pdf-link` and a `external-link` with a given `external-name`.  These are useful for linking to published versions of journal articles.
